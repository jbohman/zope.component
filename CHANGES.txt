CHANGES
*******

3.6.0 (unreleased)
==================

- Added a pure-Python 'hookable' implementation, for use when
  'zope.hookable' is not present.

- Undeprecated the interfaces in the 'bbb' package:  the promised
  removal hasn't happened, and other core pacakges are still using
  them.  Moved them into ``zope.component.interfaces``, their original
  location, and the one from which consumers have been importing them.

- Removed use of 'zope.deferredimport' by breaking import cycles.

- Cleanup package documentation and changelog a bit. Add sphinx-based
  documentation building command to the buildout.

- Remove deprecated code.

- Change package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, because
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.

3.5.1 (2008-07-25)
==================

- Fix bug introduced in 3.5.0: <utility factory="..."> no longer supported
  interfaces declared in Python and always wanted an explicit provides="..."
  attribute. https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/251865

3.5.0 (2008-07-25)
==================

- Support registration of utilities via factories through the component registry
  and return factory information in the registration information. This fixes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/240631

- Optimized un/registerUtility via storing an optimized data structure for
  efficient retrieval of already registered utilities. This avoids looping over
  all utilities when registering a new one.

3.4.0 (2007-09-29)
==================

No further changes since 3.4.0a1.

3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
====================

Corresponds to zope.component from Zope 3.4.0a1.

- In the Zope 3.3.x series, ``zope.component`` was simplified yet once
  more.  See http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/LocalComponentManagementSimplification
  for the proposal describing the changes.

3.2.0.2 (2006-04-15)
====================

- Fix packaging bug:  'package_dir' must be a *relative* path.

3.2.0.1 (2006-04-14)
====================

- Packaging change: suppress inclusion of 'setup.cfg' in 'sdist' builds.

3.2.0 (2006-01-05)
==================

Corresponds to the verison of the zope.component package shipped as part of
the Zope 3.2.0 release.

- Deprecated services and related APIs. The adapter and utility registries
  are now available directly via the site manager's 'adapters' and 'utilities'
  attributes, respectively.  Services are accessible, but deprecated, and
  will be removed in Zope 3.3.

- Deprectaed all presentation-related APIs, including all view-related
  API functions. Use the adapter API functions instead.
  See http://dev.zope.org/Zope3/ImplementViewsAsAdapters`

- Deprecated 'contextdependent' package:  site managers are now looked up
  via a thread global, set during URL traversal.  The 'context' argument
  is now always optional, and should no longer be passed.

3.0.0 (2004-11-07)
==================

Corresponds to the verison of the zope.component package shipped as part of
the Zope X3.0.0 release.
